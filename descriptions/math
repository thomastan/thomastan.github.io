"<p>From separate majors in engineering and math, I'm equally capable of harnessing the power of both symbolic and numerical based math software.</p> <p>At university, I routinely took ECE courses that used MATLAB for delivering their practical emphases of the ability to use computational power and simulations in engineering. Having used MATLAB for everything from computations and numerical analysis to modelling (mostly control and avionics systems), I acquired the fluency in writing M-file scripts and functions enough to perform all simulations for my thesis and its published paper in MATLAB.</p><p>For my Mathematics major, I completed fourth year honour courses in Mathematica and R and completed other courses primarily involving Maple. I frequently utilized the R programming language frequently when needing to run simulations and visualize outputs in many of my stat-based courses as well as when I wrote my statistics based thesis and its publication. Its open source license bodes well for me so I continue to favour it today for any statistical-based needs.</p>"
