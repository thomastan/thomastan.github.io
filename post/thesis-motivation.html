    <h3>Motivation</h3>

    <p>The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), of finding the shortest tour through $n$ cities, visiting each exactly once and finishing at the starting city, is classified as an $\mathcal{NP}$-hard problem whose solutions may require unfeasible computational resources or running times even for real-world instances. By its definition, a solution to a TSP instance is not just finding a ‘good’ tour, or one better than any previously known, but is the finding of the absolute shortest tour and determining that there is no better tour possible<sup id="fnref:gatech-lowerbounds"><a href="#fn:gatech-lowerbounds" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. Applications of the TSP in fields such as logistics, telecommunications routing and microchip manufacturing often lack the need to strictly satisfy these requirements and finding just ‘short’ feasible tours is often the case. The result has been the interest in, and development of large numbers of TSP heuristic methods that yield near-optimal results. <!--more--></p>

<p>The No-Free-Lunch (NFL) theorem<sup id="fnref:NFLtheorem"><a href="#fn:NFLtheorem" class="footnote">2</a></sup> states there is no single algorithm that outperforms all others on <em>all</em> problem instances.  Nevertheless, proposed algorithms are often benchmarked for performance against a set of instances randomly generated or commonly used in the literature.  The problem with this common methodology is that the fine-tuning of a TSP-solving algorithm only achieves better performance on certain types of problem instances that contain certain characteristics.  The assertion made is that tested instances are a representative sample of those in the whole instance space, or at least those that the algorithm may face in the future.  This assertion is not necessarily true.</p>

<p>For example, in a TSP case study, instances having the characteristic that all of the inter-city distances are identical are extremely easy to solve and have many equally minimal cost solutions<sup id="fnref:LION4"><a href="#fn:LION4" class="footnote">3</a></sup>. Instances with city layouts of a different nature, including real-world national city layouts<sup id="fnref:gatech-national"><a href="#fn:gatech-national" class="footnote">4</a></sup>, have cities arranged in tight clusters of variable sizes with outlier cities not belonging to any clusters. These are more difficult for some TSP-solving algorithms to find an optimal solution for than others. Having algorithms with different performance on different classes of instances begs the question as to what makes an optimization problem hard.  The answer involves first solving the Algorithm Selection Problem (ASP) of which algorithm within a portfolio is likely to perform effective or good or best on a given set of problem instances.<sup id="fnref:CAOR"><a href="#fn:CAOR" class="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

<p>Evolutionary computing provides an insight on how broadly algorithms are stress-tested by evolving instances to generate an intentionally hard (or easy) set of instances for portfolio algorithms<sup id="fnref:jano"><a href="#fn:jano" class="footnote">6</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup id="fnref:LION4:1"><a href="#fn:LION4" class="footnote">3</a></sup>. The evolved instances lying in problem space, are tied to an evolutionary process that ensures a enough diverse set of instances is obtained.  This in includes instances on which any proposed algorithm performs badly.  These instances can validate the approach of using randomly generated and commonly used benchmarking instances for demonstrating algorithm performance by seeing if the tested instances have sufficiently represented the evolved instances.</p>

<p>Evolutionary computing can also be used to provide an algorithm as the answer to the ASP and explain why it is. Monitoring characteristics when evolving instances into more difficult ones for a given TSP-solving algorithm makes it is possible to construct performance indicators for the algorithm. The indication is a statistical generalization of the boundary where the algorithm is expected to perform well, coined as the algorithm’s ‘footprint’ by Corne<sup id="fnref:Corne"><a href="#fn:Corne" class="footnote">7</a></sup>. Smith-Miles’ work<sup id="fnref:LION4:2"><a href="#fn:LION4" class="footnote">3</a></sup> utilized self-organizing maps (SOM’s) to visualize the footprint of two competing TSP solvers in feature space.  We seek to further develop the notion of the `footprint’ and explore the suitability of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to visualize footprints and calculate metrics of their size. Analyzing footprints in feature space assists with the earlier question raised as to what makes an optimization problem hard and acts as a tool for generalizing algorithm performance to understand the strengths and weaknesses of a portfolio’s algorithms available for selection for solving the Algorithm Selection Problem.</p>
